# symbol_extractor
Impementation of an extractor to break equations in InkML format to symbols.
Concretely, this program loads an InkML file and gives the ability to the user,
through an ad-hoc user interface, to chose which ink traces compose a symbol,
what symbol is that and to save the results on an output file.

This program is part of a bigger project implemented for the International
Institute of GeoGebra during the Google Summer of Code 2015. For more
